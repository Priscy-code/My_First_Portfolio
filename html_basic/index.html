    developer. one o of my favourite programming language is flutter. i learnt flutter when i was in school then i developed
    an interest in it</p>
    <p>when i was in school, i really did not know what i wanted to do but i made research on the course and i findout that i can be a data analyst, 
        but i fell in love with coding even if i'm not good enough but i trust the process, also i find it so hard to know where exactly i'm intersted in 
        but i know i was really interested in programming, because anytime i code and i see the result i'm really happ about it.</p>
