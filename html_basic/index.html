    <p>life as a developer has not been easy, my goal was not be a developer, the next question you have to ask me is if i even have a goal. i was a very unserious girl, 
        i never for one day throught about ehat i wanted to but but the funniest thing is that i know i was going to be great, then i ask myself great in where? </p>
        <p>my name is priscilla Akwetey, i was once a student of valley view university, i studies business information system, one of my favourite is well i don't have any favourite course. 
            all my life i'm just not serious but one thing i like doing is playing, i love playing with children making then laugh and all that will not be a bad career path
        </p>
        <p>my life has chnaged since i started alx, the way i thing has changed . i don't have time for unnessary things again </p>
        <p>a very big thank you to alx fpr giving me this oppounity</p>
